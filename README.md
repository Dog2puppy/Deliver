## [Read the documentation!](https://mullets-gavin.github.io/Deliver/)

Deliver is a Roblox-based command line interface (CLI) using the native Output & Command Bar. Currently, Roblox provides no proper way to manipulate your game from a command line, and doesn’t have a proper package manager. Deliver aims to solve this solution with a work around, using the output & command bar. Luckily, it’s extremely easy to use this simple CLI.
