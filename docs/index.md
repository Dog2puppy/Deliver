# Deliver

Deliver is a Roblox-based command line interface (CLI) using the native Output & Command Bar. Currently, Roblox provides no proper way to manipulate your game from a command line, and doesn't have a proper package manager. Deliver aims to solve this solution with a work around, using the output & command bar. Luckily, it's extremely easy to use this simple CLI.

Deliver has a wide range of uses, and it continues to grow with every update. Deliver speeds up Roblox workflows by allowing you to install GitHub repositories directly in Studio, manipulate your studio settings, and more. You can view all of the commands included [here](commands.md). There's also a sweet amount of packages that have shorthand names, which you can find & install [here](packages.md).
